# Android API Level Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: Installed Android 14 but API 34 Not Showing

This is a common issue where the SDK Manager shows different version numbers than the API levels.

## Understanding Android Versions:

- **Android 14** = API Level **34**
- **Android 13** = API Level **33** 
- **Android 12** = API Level **31-32**
- **Android 11** = API Level **30**

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Check What You Actually Have Installed

1. **Open SDK Manager** in Android Studio
2. **Go to SDK Platforms tab**
3. **Check "Show Package Details"** (bottom right corner)
4. Look for what API levels are actually installed

You should see something like:
- ☑️ Android 13.0 (Tiramisu) - **API Level 33**
- ☑️ Android 14.0 (UpsideDownCake) - **API Level 34**
- ☑️ Android 15.0 (VanillaIceCream) - **API Level 35**

### Option 2: Install API 35 (Latest Stable)

Android API 35 is newer and more commonly available:

1. **SDK Manager → SDK Platforms**
2. Install **Android 15.0 (VanillaIceCream)** - API 35
3. This is more stable and widely available

### Option 3: Use API 33 (Most Compatible)

API 33 (Android 13) is the most stable and compatible:

1. Make sure **Android 13.0** is installed in SDK Manager
2. Use API 33 in your project (see below)

## Quick Fix: Use API 33

Since API 33 is widely supported and your app will work perfectly with it, let's use that.

Your `app/build.gradle.kts` should have:

```kotlin
android {
    compileSdk = 33
    
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 24
        targetSdk = 33
        // ... rest of config
    }
}
```

## Verification Steps:

1. **Check SDK Location**:
   - File → Settings → Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → Android SDK
   - Note the "Android SDK Location" path
   - Manually browse to that folder and check `platforms/` folder
   - You should see folders like `android-33`, `android-34`, etc.

2. **Check Installed Platforms**:
   ```powershell
   dir "C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platforms"
   ```
   Or wherever your SDK is located.

3. **If platforms folder is empty or missing**:
   - SDK didn't install properly
   - Try uninstalling and reinstalling from SDK Manager
   - Or manually download from: https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads

## What I Recommend:

✅ **Use API 33** - It's the most stable and your app will work perfectly
- Widely supported
- Less compatibility issues  
- Your app will still run on Android 14 devices

The minimum SDK is 24 (Android 7.0), so your app will work on any Android phone from 2016 onwards, which covers 99%+ of devices.
